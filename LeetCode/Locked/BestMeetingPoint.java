 * As long as you have different numbers of people on your left and on your right, 
 * moving a little to the side with more people decreases the sum of distances. 
 * So to minimize it, you must have equally many people on your left and on your right. 
 * Same with above/below.
 * Thus we need to have median of the rows and cols so that we will have equal number of people
