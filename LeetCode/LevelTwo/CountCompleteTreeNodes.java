/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/
 * We are given that the binary tree is complete(In a complete binary tree every level, 
 * except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as 
 * far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.).
 * Complexity log(n) * log(n)
 * It first walks all the way left and right to determine the height and whether it's a full tree, 
 * meaning the last row is full. If so, then the answer is just 2^height-1. 
 * And since always at least one of the two recursive calls is such a full tree, 
 * at least one of the two calls immediately stops. Again we have runtime O(log(n)^2).
 * 
 * Basically its a kind of binary search.
