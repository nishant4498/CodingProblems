 * 
 * Basically here we need to count how many multiples of 5, 25, 125 ... are present in the number.
 * Since every zero is created by a multiple of 5 * 2. The number of zeroes will be equal to the 
 * number of 5's in the number. We consider 25, 125 as 25 consists of two 5's 125 3 5's and so on.
 * This needs to be considered.
