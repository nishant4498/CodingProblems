/**
 * CTCI - 16.26
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/
 * 
 * Basically there are couple of things to take care of for solving elegantly:
 * We will run through the expression 3 + 2 - 5 * 4 for understanding:
 * 
 * 1) We need three variables here for holding numbers, 
 * 		result -> Keeps the result computed till now.
 * 		prev -> keeps hold of the previous number emcountered
 *      num -> current number being processed.
 * 2) We have md and sign to take care of which operator we have encountered.
 * 3) One very important point to note is, if we encounter +/- operator, we can directly compute the
 *    previous result. But in case of * or / we have to wait for the next operand.
 *    
 *    e.g when we encounter - sign in the above expression, we can go can add prev(here 2) to the 
 *    result computed till now(i.e 3) and we update the sign for the next result computation. 
 * 4) So after processing every number we need to see if there has been a m or d encountered.
 *    In that case we need to process the number( here 4) with the prev number(5).
 *    
 * 5) The biggest challenge with understanding this implemnetation is to, usally we think from start to end,
 *    but we need to code this from end to beginning. e.g. - Checking the md sign right after fetching a number.
