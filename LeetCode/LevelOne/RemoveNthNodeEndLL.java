 * https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/
 * 
 * We solve this question using a one pass & two pointer method.
 * Important point to note is that the first pointer(fast) should move n+1 steps so that the
 * gap bw second and first pointer is n. In this case when first pointer will reach the end,
 * the second pointer will be just before the nth node from end.

		 * Dummy node helps here. In case we have just one node head, this

		 * To try things just remove the dummy node logic at leetcode and see the issues.
